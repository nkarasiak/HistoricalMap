about=Made by Nicolas Karasiak & Antoine Lomellini<br>Based on the work of Pierre-Alexis with the help of Mathieu Fauvel.<br><br>This plugin allow the user to filter an image (tif) with closing filter and median filter (you can set the parameters), then you can train with a shapefile of your perimeter, and to finish you get a shapefile with your selected class (ie: a shapefile of the forest from historical map, or of the  vineyards...)<br><br><b>We suggest you to install SciKit-Learn before installing the plugin (or you will be forced to use GMM classifier and not KNN,RF or SVM).<br>For more information you can consult our tutorial at the <a href="https://github.com/lennepkade/Historical-Map/">Historical Map plugin page</a>.
